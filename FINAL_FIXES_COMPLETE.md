## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Order Status Update - "[object Object]" Error
**Problem:** Error message was being serialized incorrectly  
**Solution:** 
- Improved error handling in `Orders.jsx`
- Now shows proper error messages from backend

### 2. ✅ Edit User - "Method Not Allowed"
**Problem:** Backend PUT endpoint wasn't accepting the request properly  
**Solution:** 
- Added field validation to only allow safe fields to be updated
- Added `allowed_fields` list to prevent updating sensitive data

### 3. ✅ Delete Review Not Working
**Problem:** Only user who created review could delete it  
**Solution:** 
- Added new `/admin/reviews/{review_id}` endpoint
- Admins can now delete any review
- Updated API call in frontend

### 4. ✅ Order Delete/Cancel Not Working
**Problem:** Order could only be cancelled if status was PENDING or CONFIRMED  
**Solution:** 
- Added new `/admin/orders/{order_id}` endpoint
- Admins can now cancel any order (except already cancelled)
- Updated API call in frontend
