   - API: `GET /cart`  
   - Create: `frontend/src/pages/Cart.jsx`

2. **Checkout Page** - Complete purchase  
   - API: `POST /orders`  
   - Create: `frontend/src/pages/Checkout.jsx`

3. **Order History** - View past orders  
   - API: `GET /orders`  
   - Create: `frontend/src/pages/Orders.jsx`

4. **Profile Page** - User settings  
   - API: `GET /users/me`  
   - Create: `frontend/src/pages/Profile.jsx`

All backend endpoints are ready! Just add the UI components.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### Port Already in Use?
- Frontend is configured to use port **3000**
- If still issues, check: `netstat -ano | findstr :3000`

### Backend Not Running?
```bash
# Start backend
python main.py
# Should show: "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:9000"
```

### Frontend Not Starting?
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Should show: "Local: http://localhost:3000"
```

### Can't Login?
- Make sure backend is running
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API is accessible: http://localhost:9000/health
