## 3. Business Processes

### 3.1 Customer Shopping Process

**Overview**: The customer shopping process is the core workflow that enables end-users to discover, evaluate, and purchase products from the e-commerce platform. This process encompasses multiple touchpoints from product discovery through order completion and provides the foundation for the entire business model.

**Process Flow**:

**Phase 1 - Product Discovery (Browse & Search)**:
The customer journey begins when a user visits the platform and seeks to find products. Customers can browse products through organized category pages, view featured and bestseller sections, use the search functionality with keyword queries, or filter products by various attributes such as price range, brand, rating, or availability status. The system must provide intuitive navigation, quick access to product information, and responsive search results. Real-time filtering allows customers to narrow down from thousands of products to their specific needs.

**Phase 2 - Product Evaluation (View Details)**:
Once a customer finds a product of interest, they need detailed information to make purchase decisions. The product details page must display comprehensive information including high-quality images from multiple angles, detailed descriptions, technical specifications, customer reviews and ratings, stock availability indicators, pricing information including any current discounts or sale prices, and comparison options with similar products. Customer-generated content such as reviews and images helps build trust and assists in decision-making.

**Phase 3 - Cart Management (Add to Cart)**:
When customers decide to purchase, they add products to their shopping cart with specific quantities. The system must validate stock availability, check for any quantity limits per customer, calculate real-time pricing including applicable discounts or promotional pricing, and maintain cart persistence across browser sessions and devices. Customers can adjust quantities, remove items, apply or remove discount coupons, and review the complete cart contents with itemized pricing before proceeding.

**Phase 4 - Checkout Process (Apply Coupons & Payment)**:
Before completing the transaction, customers apply discount coupons if available, provide shipping address information either by entering new details or selecting from previously saved addresses, provide billing information which may differ from shipping address, select shipping method from available options (standard shipping may be free over certain order thresholds), choose payment method from accepted options including credit/debit cards, PayPal, bank transfers, or cash on delivery depending on location, review complete order summary with itemized totals showing subtotals, shipping costs, tax calculations, applied discounts, and final total amount.

**Phase 5 - Order Completion (Place Order & Track)**:
Upon final review and confirmation, customers submit their order. The system processes the payment through selected payment method, validates all inventory to ensure products are still available, reserves the inventory quantities in the system, generates unique order number for tracking purposes, sends order confirmation email to customer with complete order details, redirects customer to order confirmation page with order number and estimated delivery information, provides tracking capabilities so customer can monitor order status through delivery, and sends shipment notifications when order status changes.

### 3.2 Order Fulfillment Process

**Overview**: The order fulfillment process manages the complete lifecycle of customer orders from initial creation through delivery to final completion. This process ensures accurate inventory management, timely order processing, customer communication, and comprehensive status tracking throughout the fulfillment workflow.

**Detailed Process Flow**:

**Phase 1 - Order Initiation and Inventory Reservation (Order Creation)**:
When a customer successfully completes the checkout process, the system immediately creates an order record in the database with all relevant details including customer information, shipping and billing addresses, selected payment method, order items with quantities and prices, applied discount coupons, shipping method and cost, tax calculations, and final total amount. Simultaneously, the system automatically reserves the required inventory quantities for each product in the order to prevent overselling. This inventory reservation locks the stock, making it unavailable for other potential orders while maintaining accurate product availability displays. The system also performs critical validation checks including verifying all items are still in stock, ensuring quantities haven't changed, revalidating coupon eligibility, checking payment information integrity, and confirming all shipping and billing address requirements are met. Upon successful creation, the system generates a unique order number using the format "ORD-YYYYMMDD-[RandomHash]" for easy customer reference and tracking.

**Phase 2 - Order Confirmation and Customer Notification**:
Immediately following successful order creation, the system sends automated order confirmation communications to the customer. This includes generating and sending an order confirmation email containing complete order details such as order number, order date, list of purchased items with prices and quantities, shipping address, payment method, order total breakdown, and estimated delivery timeframe. The system also provides an on-screen order confirmation page displaying the same information with visual confirmation elements like checkmark icons, order summary cards, and clear call-to-action buttons for viewing order details, continuing shopping, or accessing order history. Additionally, the system may send SMS notifications (simulated) for high-value orders or orders marked as important by the customer.

**Phase 3 - Order Verification and Payment Processing**:
Before marking the order as ready for fulfillment, the system must verify payment has been successfully processed. For credit and debit card transactions, the system validates card details, processes payment authorization (simulated), and confirms payment has been captured. For alternative payment methods like PayPal or bank transfers, the system verifies payment initiation and provides appropriate confirmation messages. In cases where payment is pending or failed, the order remains in a "Pending Payment" status with notifications sent to both the customer and administrative staff. Once payment is confirmed, the order automatically transitions to "Processing" status and becomes eligible for fulfillment operations.

**Phase 4 - Order Processing and Preparation**:
Administrative staff access the order management dashboard where they review newly created orders awaiting fulfillment. The system provides filtering capabilities to show orders by status, date range, shipping method, priority level, or customer segment. Staff review complete order information including customer details and contact information, ordered items with individual SKUs and quantities, special instructions or notes, shipping preferences, and packaging requirements. During processing, staff may need to adjust order details such as splitting shipments across multiple packages if items are from different warehouse locations, applying manual discounts for special circumstances, adding internal notes for customer service reference, or flagging orders requiring special handling. The system updates order status to "Processing" and records the timestamp along with which admin initiated processing for audit trail purposes.

**Phase 5 - Inventory Allocation and Stock Updates**:
As orders move through processing, the system manages inventory with granular precision. The reserved inventory quantities allocated during order creation are now officially sold and removed from available stock. For each product in the order, the system decreases current stock quantity, updates reserved quantity (if separate tracking), calculates remaining available stock, checks if stock has fallen below minimum threshold levels, generates low stock alerts if applicable, triggers out-of-stock notifications if inventory reaches zero, maintains historical inventory movement records for auditing and reporting purposes, and updates average product ratings if reviews are associated. The system also handles scenarios such as partial order fulfillment if some items are unavailable, backorder creation for out-of-stock items, and automatic restock notifications when inventory is replenished.

**Phase 6 - Order Shipment and Tracking**:
When orders are ready for shipment, administrative staff update the order status to "Shipped" in the system. The staff enters essential shipment information including actual shipping date, carrier name and service level (standard, express, overnight), tracking number assigned by the carrier which becomes visible to customers, estimated delivery date provided by the carrier, and any special shipment notes. Upon status update to "Shipped", the system automatically triggers shipment confirmation communications including generating shipment notification emails to customers with tracking information, sending SMS text notifications (simulated) for customers who opted in, updating the customer's order history with shipment status, providing clickable tracking links that open carrier websites, and notifying customer service team of shipment completion for proactive customer outreach. The system also calculates and displays shipping timelines based on shipping method selected and destination location.

**Phase 7 - Order Delivery and Completion**:
As shipments reach their destinations, administrative staff or the system itself (in automated scenarios) updates order status to "Delivered" based on carrier delivery confirmations, customer delivery notifications, or tracking information updates. The system automatically triggers delivery confirmation communications including sending delivery confirmation emails to customers asking for feedback, requesting customer reviews of purchased products, soliciting product ratings, and providing links to related products or future special offers. Upon delivery confirmation, the order typically transitions to "Completed" status within a specified timeframe (e.g., 7 days after delivery) automatically, representing the successful conclusion of the order fulfillment process. The system also handles exceptional cases such as failed delivery attempts, returns processing, refund authorization, and delivery feedback collection.

### 3.3 Inventory Management Process

**Overview**: The inventory management process is critical for maintaining accurate product availability information, preventing stock-outs and overselling scenarios, managing warehouse operations efficiently, and ensuring customer expectations are met regarding product availability. This process involves continuous monitoring, automated alerts, and strategic stock planning.

**Detailed Process Flow**:

**Phase 1 - Product Cataloging and Initial Stock Setup**:
When new products are added to the catalog, administrative staff must establish the initial inventory baseline. This process begins with creating comprehensive product records including assigning unique SKU identifiers for each product variation, establishing product attributes such as name, description, category, brand, and technical specifications, setting pricing structures including standard retail price, cost price for profit margin calculations, optional sale price for promotional periods, multi-currency support capabilities, and pricing history tracking for analysis. For inventory, staff sets the initial stock quantity based on purchase orders, warehouse receipts, or vendor deliveries, defines minimum stock thresholds that trigger reorder alerts (default is 5 units), establishes maximum stock levels to prevent overstock situations, sets up backorder handling rules for out-of-stock scenarios, configures stock alert notification preferences, and links stock to specific warehouse locations if multi-location inventory is in use.

**Phase 2 - Continuous Stock Monitoring and Availability Tracking**:
The system continuously monitors inventory levels for every product across the entire catalog. Real-time stock tracking involves updating quantities as orders are placed and fulfilled, tracking reserved inventory separately from available inventory, maintaining pending reservations for items in customer shopping carts for limited durations, calculating available stock by subtracting reserved and sold quantities from total inventory, displaying real-time availability to customers in user-friendly formats (In Stock, Low Stock, Only X Left, Out of Stock), and providing stock level visibility to administrators in dashboard views. The system implements sophisticated algorithms to handle concurrent order creation, inventory reservation conflicts, and preventing race conditions where multiple customers attempt to purchase the last available item simultaneously.

**Phase 3 - Automated Low Stock Alerts and Reorder Management**:
When inventory levels drop below the predetermined minimum threshold, the system automatically generates comprehensive alerts to appropriate staff members. Low stock alerts include immediate email notifications to inventory managers when threshold is reached, SMS alerts for critical fast-moving items that deplete quickly, visual indicators in the admin dashboard showing all low-stock products, priority ranking of alerts based on sales velocity and urgency, detailed reports listing affected products with current stock counts and recent sales trends, and recommendations for restocking quantities based on historical sales data. The system also enables automated purchase order generation suggestions, calculates economic order quantities (EOQ) based on holding costs and demand patterns, tracks supplier lead times to ensure timely restocking, maintains reorder point calculations that consider average daily sales and safety stock requirements, and generates purchase order templates pre-filled with recommended quantities.

**Phase 4 - Stock Movement Tracking and Audit Trail**:
Every inventory change must be meticulously tracked for both operational purposes and financial reconciliation. Stock movement transactions are recorded for order shipments that reduce available inventory, order cancellations that restore inventory, manual stock adjustments by administrators, inventory transfers between warehouse locations, cycle count corrections that account for physical inventory discrepancies, supplier receipts that increase stock levels, damaged or expired goods removals that decrease inventory, promotional inventory allocations for special events, and write-off scenarios for unsellable merchandise. Each inventory transaction stores complete audit trail information including timestamp of the change, user who initiated the change, reason code for the adjustment, before and after quantity values, unit cost at time of transaction, affected product SKU and identification, and any associated order or transfer references. This comprehensive tracking enables detailed inventory reporting, cost analysis, loss investigation, and compliance auditing.

**Phase 5 - Advanced Inventory Features and Optimization**:
Beyond basic stock management, the system supports sophisticated inventory optimization features. Multi-location inventory management allows tracking stock across multiple warehouses, distribution centers, or retail locations with the ability to allocate orders to the nearest or most efficient location. Batch inventory updates enable administrators to modify stock levels for multiple products simultaneously, apply percentage increases or decreases across product categories, import stock data from spreadsheets or external systems, and synchronize inventory with physical warehouse management systems. Inventory forecasting utilizes historical sales data to predict future demand, seasonal trends to adjust stock levels accordingly, machine learning algorithms to refine predictions over time, and supplier performance data to optimize reorder timing. The system also supports consignment inventory tracking where products are held but not owned until sold, drop-shipping scenarios where inventory never physically enters the warehouse, and partial shipments where products are allocated across multiple orders based on availability.

**Integration Requirements**:

**Order Fulfillment Integration**:
- Real-time inventory impact during order placement process
- Automatic stock reservation upon order creation
- Inventory release upon order cancellation within designated timeframe
- Immediate stock updates when orders transition to "Shipped" status
- Verification of availability before allowing checkout completion
- Handling of overselling scenarios with customer notification and backorder creation

**Reporting and Analytics Integration**:

- Days inventory outstanding (DIO) metrics for management dashboards
- ABC analysis to identify high-value products requiring closer monitoring
- Slow-moving inventory identification to prevent dead stock accumulation
- Seasonal inventory planning tools based on historical patterns
- Cost of goods sold (COGS) calculations using current inventory values

**Quality Control Integration**:
- Track inventory with expiration dates for perishable goods
- Serial number tracking for high-value or regulated products
- Lot number tracking for batch recalls if quality issues emerge
- Condition grading for returned merchandise before restocking
- Automated quarantine workflows for suspected defective inventory

### 3.4 User Management Process

**Overview**: The user management process encompasses all activities related to creating, maintaining, and controlling user accounts within the platform. This process handles new user registration, authentication and authorization, profile management, role-based access control, and administrative oversight of user accounts. The system supports multiple user roles with distinct permissions and provides secure authentication mechanisms to protect user data and platform integrity.

**Detailed Process Flow**:

**Phase 1 - User Registration and Account Creation**:
When a new user wishes to access the platform, they initiate the registration process by providing essential information. The registration form collects email address which must be unique and follow valid email format conventions, username that must be unique and meet minimum character requirements (3+ characters), password with strong requirements including minimum 8 characters with recommended mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters, first name and last name for personalization, and optional phone number for customer service contact. During registration, the system performs comprehensive validation including checking email format against RFC standards and ensuring uniqueness by querying existing users, verifying username meets requirements and doesn't conflict with existing usernames, validating password strength and complexity, confirming password and confirmation password match, checking for any blocked email domains or suspicious patterns, and verifying terms of service acceptance. Upon successful validation, the system creates the user account in a pending state requiring email verification, assigns default role of "Customer" to new users, sets account status to "Active" for administrative review, generates secure password hash using bcrypt algorithm with appropriate salt rounds, stores user information in the database with encrypted sensitive fields, creates a verification token with expiration timestamp, sends email verification message to the registered email address containing verification link with embedded token, and displays success message to user with instructions for email verification. New users must verify their email address before gaining full account access (simulated process in this testing environment).

**Phase 2 - Email Verification and Account Activation**:
After receiving the verification email, users click the verification link which contains an embedded security token. The system processes the verification request by extracting the verification token from the link, querying the database for matching pending users with the provided token, validating token hasn't expired (typically 24 hours), checking token hasn't been previously used for another verification, updating user status to "Verified" in the database, updating email_verified flag to true and recording verification timestamp, clearing the verification token to prevent reuse, sending welcome email to newly verified users with platform information and tips, granting full account access including ability to make purchases and write reviews, and redirecting user to the platform dashboard. If verification fails due to expired token or invalid token, the system provides clear error messaging and offers options to request new verification email or contact support.

**Phase 3 - User Authentication and Session Management**:
Verified users log into their accounts using registered credentials. The login process involves the user entering email address and password on the login page, the system validating input format and presence of required fields, retrieving the user record from database using email as lookup key, comparing submitted password with stored bcrypt hash using secure password verification, checking if account is active and not suspended, verifying user hasn't been blocked for security reasons, generating JWT (JSON Web Token) access token containing user identification information, creating refresh token for seamless session renewal, setting appropriate token expiration times (30 minutes for access token, 7 days for refresh token), storing tokens securely in client-side storage (localStorage) for subsequent API requests, updating last_login timestamp in user record, recording login IP address for security auditing, sending login notification email (simulated) for security awareness, and redirecting user to appropriate dashboard based on their role. For enhanced security, the system implements account lockout after multiple failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts locks account for 30 minutes), rate limiting on login endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks, CAPTCHA challenges for suspicious login attempts (future enhancement), optional two-factor authentication for high-security accounts (future enhancement), and comprehensive audit logging of all authentication events for security analysis.

**Phase 4 - Profile Management and Personal Information**:
Once logged in, users can manage their profile information throughout their account lifecycle. Users access profile management through their account settings page where they can update their personal details including first name, last name, which are displayed on orders and communications, phone number for customer service contact purposes, and optional profile picture for personalization (future enhancement). The system enforces business rules during profile updates such as preventing modification of email address without special admin approval to prevent account hijacking, blocking username changes after initial registration to maintain consistency, validating phone number format when entered, applying character limits to text fields to prevent database issues, sanitizing all input to prevent injection attacks, and maintaining change history for audit purposes. Users can also manage their preferences including notification preferences for marketing emails, promotional communications, and order updates, saved addresses for faster checkout, payment method storage (tokenized and encrypted), shopping list and wishlist management, and privacy settings control. Each profile update requires re-authentication for sensitive changes like email or password modification.

**Phase 5 - Role Assignment and Administrative Management**:
The platform implements role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions across different user types. Four primary roles exist in the system: Customer role provides standard shopping capabilities including browsing products, making purchases, writing reviews, managing wishlists, and accessing personal order history with no administrative privileges. Admin role has complete system access including managing all products, viewing all orders and updating their status, managing all user accounts, moderating reviews and content, managing coupons and promotions, accessing advanced analytics and reports, system configuration access, and data export capabilities. Moderator role focuses on content management with permissions for approving or rejecting product reviews, deleting inappropriate content, viewing basic statistics, managing review moderation queue, and responding to customer concerns about reviews without access to financial or user management. Support role provides customer service capabilities including viewing customer order history, accessing customer information for support purposes, updating order status within limited constraints, viewing customer communication history, and placing orders on behalf of customers without ability to delete data or modify financial information. Administrators can assign roles during user creation or by editing existing users, though role changes require appropriate authorization and logging for security audit purposes.

**Phase 6 - Account Status Management and Deactivation**:
The system provides multiple mechanisms for managing account lifecycles and ensuring platform security. Active accounts allow full access to all features permitted by user role. Inactive accounts are temporarily disabled by administrators, typically for security concerns, payment issues, or policy violations, which prevents login and blocks all platform access while preserving user data. Deleted accounts represent permanent account removal (soft delete) where all personally identifiable information is anonymized but transaction records are maintained for legal and accounting requirements. Suspended accounts indicate severe policy violations requiring administrative review before any restoration can occur. The system handles account status changes through administrative actions including bulk deactivation for inactive users, automated suspension for policy violations with defined trigger conditions, manual account restoration by administrators when issues are resolved, comprehensive audit trails recording who changed status and when, and email notifications to affected users explaining status changes and remediation steps. Administrators cannot delete or deactivate their own accounts to prevent lockout scenarios, and when deleting users, the system checks for active orders and prevents deletion if outstanding transactions exist.

**Integration Requirements**:

**Authentication System Integration**:
- JWT token generation and validation across all protected endpoints
- Refresh token rotation for enhanced security
- Token expiration handling with automatic refresh workflows
- Session management for concurrent user access
- Cross-domain authentication support for distributed services
- Single sign-on (SSO) capability for enterprise customers (future)

**Database Integration for User Data**:
- Secure storage of password hashes using industry-standard bcrypt
- Encrypted storage for sensitive personal information
- Indexed lookups for email and username uniqueness verification
- Efficient queries for role-based permission checking
- Audit trail maintenance for compliance and security
- Data retention policies aligned with privacy regulations (GDPR considerations)

**Notification System Integration**:
- Automated email sending for verification and password reset workflows
- SMS notifications for critical account changes (simulated environment)
- Push notifications for mobile applications (future enhancement)
- Multi-channel communication preferences per user
- Template-based messaging for consistent communication style

### 3.5 Review and Moderation Process

**Overview**: The review and moderation process enables customers to share their product experiences while protecting brand integrity through administrative oversight. This process manages customer feedback from initial submission through moderation, publication, and ongoing management. Reviews significantly influence purchase decisions, making effective moderation critical for maintaining trust, preventing abuse, and ensuring authentic customer experiences are highlighted.

**Detailed Process Flow**:

**Phase 1 - Review Submission and Initial Validation**:
When customers who have purchased products want to share their experience, they access the review submission interface on product detail pages. The review submission process requires several key elements starting with rating selection where customers choose a star rating from 1 to 5 stars representing their overall satisfaction. This rating is mandatory and directly impacts product average ratings displayed prominently throughout the catalog. Customers then write a review title which provides a brief summary and appears in bold on product pages, followed by the review comment where customers provide detailed feedback about their experience including product quality, functionality, value proposition, unexpected features, or concerns encountered. The system automatically captures submission timestamp and associates the review with the correct product and customer accounts. During submission, the system performs immediate validation checking if the customer has previously reviewed this specific product to enforce one-review-per-product-per-user policy which prevents spam and ensures diverse feedback, verifying the customer account is active and not suspended which prevents abuse from banned accounts, validating rating is within acceptable range of 1-5 stars, checking review text meets minimum character requirements (e.g., 10 characters) to ensure substantive content, and screening for obviously inappropriate content using keyword filters to flag problematic language immediately.

**Phase 2 - Verified Purchase Authentication and Badge Assignment**:
To enhance credibility and authenticity of reviews, the system implements a verified purchase badge system. When reviews are submitted, the system checks the customer's order history to verify whether they have purchased the specific product being reviewed. If a recent order (typically within 90-180 days of review submission) exists for the exact product SKU, the system marks the review with a "Verified Purchase" badge, which provides significant social proof to other customers and increases the review's perceived credibility. The verification process examines completed orders in the customer's history, matches product SKUs exactly to prevent confusion between similar items, considers reasonable timeframe for review submission after purchase, and assigns the verified_purchase flag to true. Verified purchase reviews often receive preferential display positioning in search and sort results, making them more prominent to potential buyers. Non-verified purchase reviews are still accepted to allow for gift recipients, early product testers, or customers who purchased through alternative channels, but these don't receive the verified badge and may appear lower in review listings.

**Phase 3 - Initial Moderation Queuing and Admin Notification**:
Immediately after successful review submission, all reviews enter a moderation queue awaiting administrative approval before publication. The system organizes pending reviews in the admin dashboard with sorting and filtering capabilities including sorting by submission date to ensure oldest reviews are moderated first, filtering by product category for specialized moderation if products require category-specific knowledge, displaying unread/new reviews prominently for quick attention, grouping by product to allow bulk moderation when multiple reviews exist for same product, and highlighting reviews flagged by automated systems for potential issues. Administrators receive automatic notifications alerting them to new reviews requiring moderation, which ensures timely content publication and prevents bottleneck situations. The notification system sends email alerts (simulated) to designated moderation staff, displays in-app notification badges showing pending review count, provides mobile notifications if applicable, and logs all notification attempts for audit purposes. Reviews remain hidden from public product pages until approved, preventing inappropriate content from ever reaching customers.

**Phase 4 - Administrative Review and Decision Making**:
Administrators access the moderation queue through the admin panel where they can view complete review information. The moderation interface displays the review being evaluated including full review text, customer-provided rating (1-5 stars), review title, submission date and timestamp, customer information such as username and profile history, order information showing proof of purchase if available, customer's purchase history helping identify potential fake reviews, and any automated flags indicating potential concerns. Administrators evaluate reviews based on multiple criteria including content quality assessing whether review provides useful information to other customers, authenticity checking for signs of fake or incentivized reviews such as identical wording across multiple accounts, appropriateness ensuring language and content aligns with community standards, relevance confirming review actually addresses the product rather than shipping or unrelated issues, completeness evaluating whether review provides substantive feedback beyond minimal character requirements, and helpfulness potential estimating whether other customers would find the review informative. Based on evaluation, administrators make moderation decisions including approving review for immediate publication which makes review visible to all customers on the product page, rejecting review with optional rejection reason such as inappropriate language, spam content, irrelevant feedback, or violations of review guidelines, requesting revision which can only be done for reviews submitted directly by the platform (internal reviews), or flagging review for additional review by senior moderators for borderline cases requiring team discussion.

**Phase 5 - Review Publication and Public Display**:
Once approved by administrators, reviews become publicly visible on product detail pages. The publication process updates the review status in the database to "Approved", makes review immediately visible on product page to all customers, triggers recalculation of product average rating since new review affects overall average, updates total review count displayed prominently on product, sends confirmation email to reviewer thanking them for feedback, and creates notification to product seller if applicable. Published reviews appear in the reviews section of product pages with comprehensive information including the reviewer's username or display name (privacy-respecting formatting), the star rating displayed visually as filled/unfilled stars, the review title in bold text, the complete review comment text, verified purchase badge prominently displayed if applicable, submission date shown as "reviewed X days ago" for recency context, helpful votes count showing how many customers found review useful, response capability allowing customers to comment or ask questions (future enhancement), and flag option for reporting inappropriate reviews by other customers. Reviews are sorted by default to show most helpful or most recent first, with options for customers to filter by rating or verified purchase status.

**Phase 6 - Review Management and Ongoing Moderation**:
After publication, reviews continue to be monitored for quality and appropriateness. Customers can mark reviews as helpful or not helpful, which influences review positioning and prominence. The system tracks helpful vote counts and prominently displays reviews that receive most helpful votes, as these represent highly valuable feedback. Review flags from customers trigger moderation workflows where customers can report inappropriate content such as spam reviews, offensive language, promotional content, misinformation, or violations of community guidelines. When reviews are flagged, the system adds them back to moderation queue for administrative review, allowing administrators to re-evaluate and potentially remove or edit flagged reviews. Administrative actions post-publication include editing reviews to correct factual errors while preserving original intent, deleting reviews confirmed as inappropriate through customer flags or policy violations, promoting reviews to featured status for exceptional feedback, hiding reviews from public view while maintaining data for analytics, or responding to reviews publicly to show customer service engagement (future enhancement). The system maintains comprehensive audit trails recording who performed moderation actions and when, creating accountability and enabling analysis of moderation effectiveness.

### 3.6 Coupon Management Process

**Overview**: The coupon management process controls the creation, activation, application, tracking, and deactivation of promotional discount codes throughout the e-commerce platform. Coupons serve as powerful marketing tools to drive sales, reward customer loyalty, clear inventory, attract new customers, and incentivize purchases. This process must balance marketing objectives with business rules to prevent abuse while maximizing promotional impact.

**Detailed Process Flow**:

**Phase 1 - Coupon Creation and Configuration**:
Administrators create promotional coupons through the admin panel's coupon management interface. The coupon creation process begins with defining the coupon code which is the unique identifier customers will enter at checkout. The code must be memorable and promotional (e.g., "SAVE20OFF", "FREESHIP2024"), must be unique across all active and expired coupons to prevent conflicts, should be alphanumeric and ideally all uppercase for clarity, and automatically checks against existing codes to ensure uniqueness. Administrators then assign a descriptive coupon name for internal identification such as "Black Friday 20% Off" or "Summer Sale - Free Shipping". The discount type selection determines how the discount is calculated with three primary types available: percentage discounts apply a percentage reduction from the total order amount (e.g., 20% off means $100 order becomes $80), fixed amount discounts subtract a specific dollar amount from the order total (e.g., "$50 off" means $300 order becomes $250), and free shipping coupons waive all shipping costs for qualified orders regardless of order value. The discount value field requires input based on selected discount type where percentage coupons require a value between 1-100 representing the percentage off, fixed amount coupons require a dollar amount representing flat reduction, and free shipping coupons may have optional minimum shipping cost value if not truly free. The minimum order amount establishes the threshold customers must meet before the coupon becomes applicable, preventing abuse of high-value discounts on tiny orders, requiring logical business rules (e.g., $50 minimum for 20% off coupons), and supporting zero minimum for truly open promotions. Usage limits control coupon distribution where total usage limit caps how many times the coupon can be used across all customers (e.g., limit to first 100 redemptions), per-user usage limit restricts how many times a single customer can use the coupon (typically 1 time to prevent stacking), and usage limits can be left unlimited for open-ended promotions. Maximum discount cap prevents excessive financial exposure where percentage coupons may include optional maximum discount limit preventing discounts over certain amount (e.g., 20% off with $200 max means $1000 order saves $200 not $200), protecting profit margins especially on expensive items, and ensuring promotional costs remain predictable.

**Phase 2 - Advanced Restrictions and Targeting**:
To maximize coupon effectiveness and prevent abuse, administrators configure sophisticated targeting rules. Category restrictions allow limiting coupons to specific product categories such as "Electronics Only" where coupon only applies to electronics category products, "Apparel Discount" where clothing items get discount, or "Exclude Sale Items" where already-discounted products are ineligible. Product restrictions enable precise targeting including allowing coupons to apply only to specific product lists (e.g., only iPhone models), excluding specific products from coupon eligibility (e.g., sale items, restricted products), and supporting bulk product targeting for manufacturer-specific promotions. Customer type restrictions segment promotion eligibility where new customer only coupons require zero previous orders, existing customer only coupons require at least one completed order, VIP customer coupons target high-value customers, and returning customer coupons target previous buyers. Time-based restrictions control when coupons become active including valid from date and time indicating when coupon becomes usable, valid until date and time marking expiration, and optional time-of-day restrictions for limited-hour promotions. Geographic restrictions enable location-based targeting such as US-only promotions, state-specific discounts, or international shipping promotions. Administrative controls include is_active flag allowing instant enable/disable without deletion, created_at timestamp for tracking creation, updated_at timestamp showing last modification, and creation user field recording which admin created the coupon.

**Phase 3 - Coupon Activation and Distribution**:
Once configured, administrators activate coupons through the admin interface. Activation makes the coupon immediately available for customer use across checkout processes throughout the platform. During activation, the system performs final validation checking that all required fields are properly configured, verifying coupon code is unique and not conflicting with existing codes, confirming validity dates are logical with start date before end date, ensuring discount values are positive and reasonable, validating usage limits are non-negative numbers, and checking business rule compatibility to ensure coupon won't cause system errors. Upon successful activation, the system updates coupon status to active, makes coupon visible in admin listings with active status indicator, enables coupon application during checkout flows, begins tracking usage statistics with initial values set to zero, and logs activation event for audit purposes. Distribution involves communicating coupon availability through email campaigns (simulated) to targeted customer segments, displaying coupon codes on homepage promotional banners or popups, including coupons in marketing newsletter campaigns, posting coupon codes on social media channels, providing coupon codes through customer service interactions, and offering coupons as loyalty rewards or compensation.

**Phase 4 - Customer Application and Validation**:
When customers proceed through checkout, they can apply eligible coupons by entering coupon codes. The application process requires customers to access the coupon entry field during checkout, typically located near order summary section. Customers type or paste the coupon code, and upon entry, the system immediately validates the coupon through comprehensive eligibility checks. Validation examines whether coupon code exists in the database with exact match required and case-insensitive comparison supported, checks if coupon is currently active meaning is_active flag is true, verifies current date and time falls within valid_from and valid_until date range, confirms order total meets or exceeds minimum_order_amount threshold, counts total usage and ensures it hasn't reached max_uses limit, checks per-user usage to ensure customer hasn't exceeded max_uses_per_user limit, validates that order contains products in applicable categories if category restrictions exist, verifies that order doesn't contain excluded products, confirms customer type matches restriction requirements (new vs existing customer), and checks for geographic restrictions if location-based rules apply. Upon successful validation, the system calculates the applicable discount amount based on discount type: for percentage coupons it multiplies subtotal by discount percentage and applies maximum discount cap if specified, for fixed amount coupons it applies the flat discount amount up to order total (cannot discount more than order value), and for free shipping coupons it calculates shipping cost and applies equivalent discount. The system then updates the order summary displaying original subtotal, showing discount line item with amount, displaying shipping cost (may be zero if covered by coupon), calculating tax on discounted amount if applicable, showing final total after all adjustments, and providing breakdown of all charges. Customers can review complete order summary with discount clearly shown, modify coupon if needed by removing and entering different code, proceed to complete order with discount applied, or cancel to remove discount and pay full price.

**Phase 5 - Discount Calculation and Application**:
When coupons are applied, the system performs precise discount calculations ensuring accuracy and preventing abuse. For percentage discounts, the system calculates by taking order subtotal, applying the percentage multiplier (e.g., 20% means multiply by 0.20), and applying any maximum discount cap if configured. For fixed amount discounts, the system subtracts the fixed dollar amount from the order subtotal, ensuring discount doesn't exceed order value (e.g., $50 off $30 order would only discount $30), and applies discount after all other calculations except final payment. For free shipping discounts, the system identifies the shipping cost for the order, calculates total shipping charges based on weight, dimensions, and destination, applies discount equal to shipping amount, and displays "Free Shipping Applied" in order breakdown. Tax calculation occurs after discount application in most jurisdictions, meaning tax is calculated on discounted amount rather than original price, ensuring accurate tax collection while honoring promotional discounts. Multiple coupons cannot be stacked simultaneously as only one coupon per order is permitted to prevent excessive discounting and maintain profit margins. Manual discounts by administrators for special circumstances are handled separately from customer-enterable coupons.

**Phase 6 - Usage Tracking and Analytics**:
Throughout coupon lifecycle, the system maintains comprehensive usage tracking for analysis and optimization. Each coupon application creates usage records containing timestamp of when coupon was used, customer identification linking to user account, order identification connecting to completed order, discount amount actually applied considering caps and restrictions, original order total before discount, final order total after discount, and any flags or notes from validation process. Real-time tracking monitors total uses across all customers comparing against max_uses limit to prevent over-redemption, per-customer usage counting applications by individual users, remaining uses calculation showing availability (e.g., "47 of 100 uses remaining"), conversion rate analysis showing how many customers who had coupon actually used it, revenue impact calculation showing total discount dollars distributed, and revenue generation analysis showing orders created by coupon users. Analytics dashboards provide administrators insights including redemption rate showing percentage of distributed coupons actually used, average discount amount per redemption, total revenue generated through coupon campaigns, customer acquisition effectiveness from new-customer-only coupons, revenue impact analysis comparing sales with vs without coupons, time-to-redemption tracking how quickly customers use coupons, and customer lifetime value analysis for coupon recipients.

**Phase 7 - Coupon Deactivation and Expiration**:
Coupons eventually reach their expiration or usage limits, requiring systematic deactivation. Automatic expiration occurs when valid_until date passes, where the system automatically disables the coupon by setting is_active to false, hides coupon from customer-facing displays, prevents new applications while honoring active orders with the coupon, maintains historical data for analytics purposes, and triggers notification to administrators about expired coupons. Manual deactivation allows administrators to disable coupons before expiration such as when promotional budgets are exhausted, preventing further usage while maintaining data integrity, updating is_active status to false, notifying administrators of manual deactivation, preserving all historical usage data for reporting, and allowing reactivation if needed. Usage limit exhaustion deactivates coupons when max_uses limit is reached, immediately preventing additional applications, recording final use statistics, sending completion report to administrators, and recommending coupon renewal if promotion was successful. After deactivation, the system maintains all coupon data for historical reporting, preserves usage statistics for campaign analysis, allows data export for financial reconciliation, and enables coupon duplication for similar future promotions.
