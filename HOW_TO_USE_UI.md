## ‚ú® Tips

1. **Hard Refresh**: If UI seems stuck, press `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

2. **Check Console**: Open browser DevTools (F12) to see any errors

3. **Check Backend Logs**: Your terminal where `python main.py` is running shows all API requests

4. **Test Both Users**: Try customer and admin workflows

5. **Use Swagger**: Test API directly at http://localhost:9000/docs for advanced features
