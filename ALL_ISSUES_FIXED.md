## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ User Update - Method Not Allowed
**Problem:** Backend lacked admin endpoint for user updates  
**Solution:** Added `@app.put("/users/{user_id}")` endpoint in `main.py`

### 2. ✅ User Delete - Backend Endpoint Missing
**Problem:** Backend lacked admin endpoint for user deletion  
**Solution:** Added `@app.delete("/users/{user_id}")` endpoint in `main.py`

### 3. ✅ Add User Functionality Missing
**Problem:** No way to create new users in admin UI  
**Solution:** 
- Added "Add User" button in Users page
- UserModal now supports both create and edit
- Integrated with `/auth/register` endpoint for creation

### 4. ✅ Order Status Update Failing
**Problem:** Order status dropdown not working  
**Solution:** Fixed API call and error handling in Orders page

### 5. ✅ Coupon Add/Edit/Delete Not Working
**Problem:** Coupon management UI was incomplete  
**Solution:** 
- Created `CouponModal.jsx` for add/edit
